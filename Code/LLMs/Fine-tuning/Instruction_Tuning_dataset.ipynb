The Salem Municipality and State of Tamil Nadu and others are in appeals aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras on 8.12.2010 thereby deciding three Second Appeals by the common judgment and order reversing the judgment and decree passed by the First Appellate Court of dismissal of the suits and restoring that of the Trial Court.2. It was claimed by the plaintiff that initially, the lease was granted in favour of S. Vijayaranga Mudaliar on 19.11.1940 by the erstwhile Zamindar \\u2013 Ms.Gnanambal. It was from the month of November 1940 to the month of June 1941.3. Similar leases had been granted on 19.11.1942 in 1943 and 1946. In the lease deed area was described as ?Chinneri Tank Bund Side -Waste dry? and ?Chinneri Tank Bund Upper-dry?.4. It is significant that each of lease had been granted for eight months, each year continued from November to June next year, to expire before the commencement of rains in July as the land used to be submerged as it was situated in Chinneri Bund side.5. It was claimed by the plaintiff that his predecessor in title, continued in possession of the land when the Act called the Tamil Nadu Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 (in short ?the Act of 1948?) came into force. The Act was published on 19.4.1949. Sections 1,2,4,5,7,8 58-A,62,67 68 came into force on 19.4.1949, as provided under Section 1(4) of the Act of 1948. The State Government enforced the other Sections on the appointed date i.e. 19.12.1950. Thereafter, the entire Pallapatti village vested in the State as notified under the Act of 1948. Pursuant thereto, the possession of the entire village was taken over by the Government, which included the disputed land also, vide possession receipt dated 12.1.1951.6. The original plaintiff \\u2013late P.C. Pachiappan purchased 4.91 acres of land from S. Vijayaranga Mudaliar. The suits are with respect to said land.7. It transpires that late Vijayaranga Mudaliar had applied for a grant of Ryotwari Patta under section 11 of the Act of 1948. The prayer was rejected on the ground that land was not ryoti land and it was recorded as community land. Thereafter, settlement in the area was undertaken and was finally notified in the Gazette dated 21.12.1963. Thereafter, P.C. Pachiappan applied under section 11 of the Act of 1948 for grant of Ryotwari patta of the newly carved out Survey No.163 corresponding to old survey No. 779. Prayer for grant of Ryotwari patta of the disputed land was rejected vide order 5.11.1968 passed in DOS 739/68 (F-2) by Assistant Settlement Officers KDIS No. 737/1968. As recorded in the survey land register, Exhibit B-2, prepared in the survey and settlement in 1959, the total area of the land 163 = 779 was 24.62 acres, recorded as Achuvan Eri (lake). Hence, it could not have been allotted.8. A second application for ryotwari patta moved by Pachiappan was rejected as per government Order dated 11.5.1971. Review application was filed by Pachiappan. It was also rejected vide order dated 7.5.1973 on the ground that records of rights made it apparent that disputed land formed part of \\u2018Achuvaneri which is IV class irrigation source with wet ayacut registered under it and that it is retained as the tank in the interest of ayacutdars under it. It was also observed that the entire area comes into submergence and the land in question forms part of the irrigation tank.9. Unfettered by the previous two rejections, Pachiappan again for the third time applied for issuance of patta on 21.6.1982. That application was ultimately rejected vide Ex. P-5 on 9.5.1984.10. On 23.2.1984, by virtue of the Office Memorandum 255, the Transport Department of the State Government handed over Survey No.163 admeasuring 24.62 acres to Salem Municipality for construction of a new bus stand.11. Pachiappan had filed a civil suit on 20.12.1984 registered as O.S.34 of 1985 in the Court of District Munsiff of Salem against the State of Tamil Nadu and M/s. Anna Transport Corporation for declaration of title and permanent injunction in respect of 4.91 acres of the land, out of survey No.163.12. Yet another civil suit came to be filed by the same plaintiff as against Salem Municipality alone for declaration and injunction on 22.12.1989.13. Thereafter, the fourth application was filed for obtaining ryotwari patta by Pachiappan on 26.3.1992. He had filed yet another writ petition No.3932/1992 for restraining the respondents from disturbing peaceful possession and enjoyment of the property.14. In Writ Petition No.5642/1992 he prayed that respondent may be directed to consider an application for grant of ryotwari patta. However, both the writ petitions were dismissed as withdrawn. Earlier writ petition filed in 1984 was also dismissed with liberty to file a civil suit.15. Third suit O.S.No.342/1996 (348/95) (renumbered as 2066/96) was filed as against Salem Municipality, Anna Transport Corporation and State of Tamil Nadu. He has prayed for the same relief in the third civil suit. 16. By virtue of the various leases granted to S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar, he became entitled to obtain ryotwari patta under Section 11 of the Act of 1948. Plaintiff entered into an agreement to purchase the suit property in 1951 which culminated into a sale on 29.9.1952. The suit property never formed part of the communal land of Achuvan Eri or its tank bund. Further, the extent of the Achuvan Eri as per the records is only 15.00 acres. The Plaintiff had remained in actual possession and enjoyment of suit property. In the year 1982, Forest Department attempted to commit a trespass in the suit property and put up a nursery. The plaintiff objected and obtained the stay orders from the Government of Tamil Nadu against trespass. The Forest Department withdrew and was restrained from further work. The plaintiff also filed applications for grant of ryotwari patta in his favour and his predecessor in interest since 1940 onwards had prescribed his title by virtue of adverse possession also.17. Earlier suit No. OS.34/1985 was dismissed in default, in the absence of both the parties. The application No.I.A. 583/94 for its restoration was pending. The cause of action arose in the year 1940, thereafter in 1952, when the sale deed was executed and again in the year 1984. Besides declaration and injunction, prayer was also made for demarcation of the property in question.18. After the restoration of the suit of 1985, three suits were decided vide common judgment and decree dated 27.4.2000 passed by the Trial Court, Additional District Munsif of Salem. The suit was decreed on 27.4.2000. The appeals were allowed by the First Appellate Court i.e., First Additional District Court, Salem vide judgment and decree dated 30.1.2004. Aggrieved thereby, three-second appeals, which were preferred have been allowed by the impugned judgment and decree thereby restoring that of the Trial Court. 19. The High Court has given the finding that there is nothing to doubt the various leases granted to S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar. Sale deed has also been relied upon, the documents A-1 to A-4 have been relied upon by the High Court. The High Court has drawn adverse inferences against the appellants for not producing record pertaining to the aforesaid documents A-1 to A-4. High Court has disbelieved documents B-9 of taking possession on 12.1.1951. Finding of possession has been arrived at in favour of the plaintiff. The High Court has also doubted the action of Salem Municipality of handing over only 19.64 acres area to the Transport Corporation for bus stand, whereas the entire land 24.62 acres has been given to the Salem Municipality by the Tamil Nadu Government. High Court has further stated that there is no estoppel created against the plaintiff by virtue of the facts mentioned in lease deeds. It has also not been explained by the defendants that how the area of 15 acres of water tank increased to 24 acres. Consequently, the High Court has set aside the judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court and restored the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court.20. Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, Shri R.Venkataramani and Shri Gurukrishna Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants urged that High Court has failed to consider the various provisions of the Act of 1908 as well as the Act of 1948. No right could have been created in the water tanks by virtue of the provisions contained in the said Acts. They have relied upon the definition of Ryot and Ryoti land in Section 3(15) and 3 (16) of the Act of 1908.21. The ryoti land as defined in section 3(16) of the said Act specifically excludes beds and bunds of tanks. It was also urged that High Court has also failed to consider the impact of dismissal of the proceedings for obtaining \\u2018Ryot Patta? under Section 11 of the Act, filed by the Predecessor in interest S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar and by the original plaintiff. The prayer of S. Vijayranga Mudaliar for grant of ryotwari patta has been rejected vide order dated 20.7.1953. Other four prayers made by Pachiappan also stood rejected in the years 1968,1971, 1984 and 1994. In the absence of a grant of ryotwari patta and even otherwise, the land remained vested in the State Government. The finding as to possession of plaintiff recorded by the High Court is also perverse and is contrary to the revenue entries, the documents of settlement and other record of rights w.e.f. 1948 till 1995. The revenue records have been placed on record and in none of them, there is an entry of possession of Pachiappan. On the strength of sale deed executed in 1952, the name of Pachiappan had never been mutated. Since Predecessor S. Vijayaranga Mudaliar had no title, late Pachiappan could not have derived any right, title or interest from him. Having failed to prove the title of S. Vijayaranga Mudaliar and also his own title, the plaintiff was not entitled to obtain the decree in his favour. Apart from that, it was also urged that though such a suit was barred under the provisions of 1948 Act. Even if it is held to be maintainable for establishing of the rights of Ryot, plaintiff has miserably failed to prove right, title or interest so as to seek declaration and injunction prayed for. The suits were rightly dismissed by the First Appellate court. Learned counsel have also referred to the decision in State of Tamil Nadu Vs. Ramalinga Samigal Madam (1985) 4 SCC 10. Even if the documents A-1 to A-4 are taken to be proved, plaintiff did not derive any sustenance from them for proving of right, title or interest over the land. The High Court has proceeded merely on the basis of adverse inference so as to confer a title in favour of the plaintiff whereas the plaintiff has miserably failed to prove his own case. They have also relied on Section 14A of the 1948 Act.22. Shri Rajiv Dutta and Shri V.Giri, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff contended that once documents A-1 to A-4 are found to be proved, right, title and interest stands proved not only of the predecessor-ininterest but that of the plaintiffs also. Finding of fact as to possession of plaintiff has been rightly recorded by the Trial Court. The decision of the First Appellate Court has been rightly reversed by the High Court. The entitlement to obtain ryotwari patta has been proved. The claim for conferral of ryotwari patta has not been properly adjudicated by the concerned authorities. Civil suits were maintainable and have been rightly decreed.23. It was also contended on behalf of plaintiff that difference in the area of the tank has not been properly explained and the area in question is not part of the tank, it was at the periphery of the tank. Thus, there was no bar under the Act of 1908 to give the same on lease to S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar and, as right, title and interest for obtaining of ryotwari patta had accrued to him, he could have alienated the property in the year 1952. Finding as to possession is also the question of fact and has been rightly arrived at by the Trial Court which has rightly been restored by the High Court. No case for interference is made out. For maintainability of the civil suit, they have relied upon the decision in Dokiseela Ramulu vs. Sri Sangameswara Swamy Varu & Ors. (2017) 2 SCC 69. Lastly, they contended that the adverse inference has rightly been drawn by the High Court.24. First, we take up the determination of question as to the nature of the land as the accrual of right, title and interest depends on that under both the Acts of 1908 and 1948. It is apparent from the lease deed placed on record by the plaintiff (Exh. A-2) dated 15.11.1940 that the land formed part of the Chinneri Tank Bund Side -Waste dry Chinneri Tank Bed Upper-dry Chinneri Tank Bund Side -Waste dry Chinneri Tank Bed Upper-dry and the lease was granted in Fasli 1350 corresponding to Gregorian calendar year of 1940 w.e.f. the month of November 1940 to June 1941. Similar other leases collectively marked A-2 are dated 19.11.1942, 1943 and 1946 w.e.f. the month of November to June. The leases were granted in the exercise of the powers under Section 51 of the Act of 1908. It is apparent from the leases that area in question is specifically depicted in the aforesaid lease deeds to form part of the tank.25. Besides that, there are a plethora of revenue entries placed on record indicating that the entire area 24.62 acres had been recorded as tank continuously right from 1950 till 1995.26. The lease had been granted for eight months in the year 1940. The grant of lease for the aforesaid period excluding rainy season from July to October and evidence indicates that land formed part of the tank. Thus, we have no hesitation in rejecting the submission to the contrary raised on behalf of the plaintiffrespondent to the effect that land did not form part of the tank.27. Now, we come to the question whether any right can be acquired on such a land. When we consider the relevant provisions contained in the Act of 1908 and definition as defined Ryot under Section 3(15) and Ryoti Land under 3(16). The same is extracted hereunder:?Section 3 (15) - ?Ryot? means a person who holds for the purpose of agriculture ryoti land in an an estate on condition of paying to the landholder the rent which is legally due upon it.?Explanation:A person who has occupied ryoti land for a continuous period of twelve years shall be deemed to be a ryot for all the purposes of this Act.Section 3 (16)- ?Ryoti land? means cultivable land in an estate other than private land but does not include;(a) beds and bunds of tanks and of supply, drainage, surplus or irrigation channels:(b) threshing floor, cattle-stands, village-sites and other lands situated in any estate which are set apart for the common use of the villagers.(c) lands granted on service tenure either free of rent or on favourable rates or rent if granted before the passing this act or free of rent if granted after that date, so longs as the service tenure subsists.? 28. It is apparent from the definition of \\u2018ryot? as defined under Section 3(15), means a person who holds the land for the purpose of agriculture. It is necessary for such a \\u2018ryot? to hold \\u2018ryoti Land? in an estate. Ryoti land has been defined in Section 3(16) as cultivable land in an estate other than private land but does not include beds and bunds of tanks and of supply, drainage, surplus or irrigation channels. Thus, as the area in question formed part of the tank was clearly not ryoti land as per the said definition in Section 3(16). As such, the predecessor in interest - S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar or plaintiff could not be said to be \\u2018ryot? holding \\u2018ryoti? land.29. The provisions contained in the 1948 Act have been enacted to bring about agrarian reforms and to abolish the intermediaries, zamindars, and Jagirdars etc. As a matter of fact, a lot of agrarian reforms have taken place by the enactment of Abolition Act, as mandated by Article 39 (b) and (c) of the Constitution. By virtue of the provisions contained in Section 3 of the Act, on issuance of notifications with effect from the notified date certain consequences ensues automatically. It is provided in Section 3(b) that entire estate including with all communal lands; porambokes, other then ryoti lands; rivers and streams; tanks and ooranies (including private tanks and ooranies and irrigation works] etc., shall stand transferred to the Government and vest in them, free of all encumbrances.30. Section 3 is extracted hereunder:?Section 3: With effect on and from the notified date and save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act:(a) the Tamil Nadu Estates Land (Reduction of Rent) Act, 1947 Tamil Nadu Act XXX of 1947 [in so far as it relates to] matters other than the reduction rents and the collection of arrears of rent and the Tamil Nadu Permanent Settlement Regulation, 1802 Tamil Nadu Regulation XXV of 1802, the Tamil Nadu Estates Land Act, 1908 Tamil Nadu Act 1 of 1908, and all other enactments applicable to the estate as such shall be deemed to have been repealed in their application to the estate](b) the entire estate including all communal lands; porambokes; other nonryoti lands; wastelands; pasture lands; Lanka lands; forests; mines and minerals; quarries; rivers and streams; tanks and ooranies (including private tanks and ooranies and irrigation works] fisheries and ferries, shall stand transferred to the Government and vest in them, free of all encumbrances and the Tamil Nadu Revenue Recovery Act, 1864, the Tamil Nadu Irrigation Cess Act, 1965, and all other enactments applicable to ryotwari areas shall apply to the estate;(c) all rights and interests created in or over the estate before the notified date by the principal or any other landholder, shall as against the Government cease and determine;(d) the Government may, after removing any obstruction that may be offered forthwith take possession of the estate, and all accounts, registers, pattas muchilikas, maps, plans and other documents relating to the estate which the Government may require for the administration thereof;Provided that the Government shall not dispossess any person of any land in the estate in respect of which they consider that he is prima facie entitled to a ryotwari patta-(i) if such person is a ryot, pending the decision of the Settlement Officer as to whether he is actually entitled to such patta;(ii) if such person is a landholder pending the decision of the Settlement Officer and the Tribunal on appeal, if any, to it, as to whether he is actually entitled to such patta;(e) the principal or any other landholder and any other person, whose rights stand transferred under clause (b) or cease and determine under clause (c), shall be entitled only to such rights and privileges as are recognized or conferred on him by or under this Act](f) the relationship of landholder and ryot, shall, as between them, be extinguished;(g) any rights and privileges which may have accrued in the estate to any person before the notified date, against the principal or any other landholder thereof, shall cease and determine, and shall not be enforceable against the Government or such landholder and every such person shall be entitled only to such rights and privileges as are recognized or conferred on him by or under this Act.]? 31. It is also provided in Section 3(c) that all rights and interests created in or over the estate before the notified date by the principal or any other landholder, shall against the Government cease and determine.32. It is apparent that under Section 3 of the Act of 1948 vesting is automatic by virtue of the statutory provisions and government is empowered to take possession as provided under Section 3 (a) only saving in the proviso to section 3(d) is that in case any person is prima facie entitled to ryotwari patta and during pendency of his application, for the settlement, was not to be dispossessed. In the case of the landholder, it is provided that if the decision is pending before the Settlement Officer and the Tribunal on appeal, the State before taking possession has to prima facie consider whether landholder is entitled to ryot patta. Another consequence of vesting as clearly provided in Section 3(f) of Act of 1948 is that the relationship between the landholder and Ryot shall stand extinguished.33. Section 3(g) of the Act of 1948 specifically provides that right which may have accrued in the estate to any person before the notified date shall not be enforceable against the government and such person shall be entitled only to such rights and privileges as are recognised or conferred on him as provided under the Act of 1948.34. Section 11 deals with rights of a ryot in an estate to apply for a ryotwari patta in respect of ryoti land which was properly included or ought to have been properly included in his holding.35. Section 11 is extracted hereunder:?Lands in which ryot in entitled to ryotwari patta:?11. Every ryot in an estate shall, with effect on and from the notified date, be entitled to a ryotwari patta in respect of ;(a) all ryoti lands which, immediately before the notified date, were properly included or ought to have been properly included in his holding and which are not either Lanka lands or lands in respect of which a landholder or some other person is entitled to a ryotwari patta under any other provision of this act; and(b) all Lanka lands in his occupation immediately before the notified date, such land having been in his occupation or in that of his predecessors-in-title continuously from the 1st day of July 1939.Provided that no person who has been admitted into possession of any land by as landholder on or after the 1st day of July 1945 shall, except where the Government, after an examination of all the circumstances otherwise direct, be entitled to a ryotwari patta in respect of such land.Explanation: No lessee of any Lanka land and no person to whom a right to collect the rent of any land has been leased before the notified date, including an ijaradar or a farmer of rent, shall be entitled to a ryotwari patta in respect of such land under this section.? 36. Section 12 deals with the right of the landholder in zamindari estate and Section 13 deals with the landholder of Inam estate with which we are not concerned in the present case. Plaintiff has claimed the right, title and interest as ryot, not as landholder.37. Section 14-A was inserted by amendment Act 49 of 1974. The provisions contained in Section 14-A is extracted hereunder;?Ryotwari patta not to be granted in respect of private tank or oorani:14-A.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, no ryotwari patta shall be granted in respect of any private tank or oorani.(2) Any ryotwari patta granted in respect of any private tank or oorani under this Act before the date of the publication of the Tamil Nadu Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Amendment Act, 1974, in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, shall stand cancelled, and for purposes of compensation under this Act the private tank or oorani shall be deemed to be land in respect of which neither the landholder nor any other person is entitled to ryotwari patta under this Act.? 38. Section 14-A(1) makes it clear that Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, no ryotwari patta shall be granted in respect of any private tank or ooranies. Even if any patta has been granted the same shall stand cancelled and the land of the private tank or oorani shall be deemed to be land of neither the landholder nor any other person is entitled to ryotwari patta under the Act.39. It is apparent from the conjoint reading of the provisions contained in Sections 3(15) and 3 (16) of the Act of 1908 and the provisions contained in Section 3, 11 and 14-A of the Act of 1948 that the land of the tank is not \\u2018ryoti land? as such no rights of \\u2018ryot? could accrue in the person by holding the land on temporary arrangement of lease granted for 8 months in a year when water was not there in the tanks. Such bodies are protected by virtue of the aforesaid provisions carved out under the Acts of 1908 and 1948. The amendment made in 1974 in Section 14-A makes it clear that even if any ryot patta has been granted to any incumbent even with respect to private tank or ooranies that shall be inoperative and stand cancelled.40. In the instant case, it is apparent that not only S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar the vendor of plaintiff had applied for a grant of patta under the provisions of Section 11 of the Act of 1948, but the same very prayer had been unsuccessfully made four times by the original plaintiff. All such prayers made in 1953, 1968, 1971, 1982 and 1994 had been rejected. It is not in dispute that ryotwari patta had not been granted. In the order passed rejecting review in 1973, there is categorical finding that land is comprised in the tank and area was liable for submergence and formed part of the irrigation tank. Once the claim of the original plaintiff had been rejected, it was incumbent upon him to file a suit for establishing his rights, if any. He could not have waited till 1984, after initial rejection of the prayer in 1953. Again, could not have waited till December 1984 after the rejection order was passed in 1968 and again on 11.5.1971 and review had been dismissed on 7.5.1973. In the absence of grant of ryotwari patta and even otherwise in view of the fact that land formed part of tank reserved for common use, no right accrued to the plaintiff to claim ryotwari patta as his predecessor was not \\u2018ryot? and the disputed land was not \\u2018ryoti Land?. Apart from that, vendor of the plaintiff did not hold land for 12 continuous years, as such no right, title or interest accrued to the vendor of the plaintiff or to the plaintiff. The Trial Court, as well as the High Court, have committed patent illegality in ignoring the aforesaid prohibition contained in the provisions of the Act of 1908 as well as of the Act of 1948.41. Coming to the question of possession, the High Court has discarded B-9 proceedings taking possession on 12.1.1951. Though, there was absolutely nothing to doubt factum of taking over the possession. It is also apparent that the land formed part of tank which used to go in submergence during the rains from the month of July to October, it was not capable of being possessed continuously. No patta was granted to the vendor of the plaintiff for a complete year at any point of time, it was from November to June. The four lease deeds for the period of four years are for 32 months i.e. 8 months each year, have been placed on record of 1940, 1942, 1943 and 1946, no other lease has been produced indicating that he was holding land for 12 years or any lease of the land as on the date when the Act of 1948 came into force or on the appointed day. Even the vendor was not in possession of the land as the entire estate of the village stood vested in the state, as per the notification issued on 12.1.1951, possession had been taken. Thus, there was absolutely nothing to hold that possession continued with the vendor of the plaintiff. After the purchase was made by Pachiappan in 1952 there is not even single revenue entry placed on record indicating that he ever remained in possession at any point of time or cultivated the land. On the other hand, various documents to the contrary have been placed on record by the appellant.42. Firstly, there are copies of settlement register indicating the land comprised in new survey No. 163 corresponds to 779 old and same is recorded as Poramboke (common land) for common use. Entire area 24.62 acre had been recorded as Poramboke. There is yet another settlement entry of 1959 which records that Survey No.163 had been carved out of 779 in an area 24.62 acre and area has been recorded as Achuveri i.e., lake and also Porampoke i.e., for the common use. The document records the fact that Pachiappan?s application for grant of ryotwari patta has been rejected on 5.11.1968. Survey Map of the village also records that the old survey number 779 has vested in the State. When we consider Exh B-13, Fasli 1379 = 1969 year (Gregorian) the land has been recorded as Chinneri (small lake). In the remarks column possession of several persons is recorded as a trespasser, but not that of the plaintiff - Pachiappan. Similar is the position in the entry of various Fasli 1380 = 1970, 1381 = 1971, 1382 = 1972, 1383 = 1973, 1384 = 1974, 1386 = 1976, 1390 = 1980, 1391 = 1981 till 1405 = 1995. The entries in remarks column shows neither ownership nor tenancy as observed by this Court in Beohar Rajendra Singh v. State of M.P. and others,1970 RN 16 (Supreme Court).43. Other documents are also placed on record indicating that area is Chinneri (lake) of common use. Thus, there was absolutely no material or ground available to the High Court to set aside the finding of possession recorded by the First Appellate Court and for discarding the B-9 of taking possession in 1951 as that was supported by corresponding revenue entries and statutory presumption of correctness is attached to such entries though such presumption is rebuttable. However, there is absolutely no evidence adduced on record by the plaintiff to rebut the statutory presumption of correctness of document of record of rights. Thus, trial court, as well as the High Court, has acted in a perverse manner in discarding the overwhelming evidence merely on the ground that document A-1 to A-4 stands proved. The High Court could not have inferred in favour of the plaintiff, as no right accrued to the plaintiff or to his predecessor-in-interest on the basis of the aforesaid document A-1 to A-4. The High Court has unnecessarily drawn adverse inference just in order to give a finding of the genuineness of the document A-1 to A-4. We take these documents as proved and proceed to deal with the case on that basis.44. When we consider the documents A1 to A-4, taken as proved, not only they fail to advance the cause espoused by the plaintiff but rather negates it. Ex.A-2 are the 4 pattas placed on record by the plaintiff granted in favour of S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar as predecessor interest of 1940, 1942, 1943 and 1946. The lease deed itself records that land was comprised in the tank and formed part of the tank. Thus, no right or title or interest could have accrued to the plaintiff over the said land. 45. Apart from that, when we consider sale deed A-1, executed by S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar in favour of original plaintiff Pachiappa, the recital in the sale deed is that though patta was granted in his name he could neither cultivate nor able to look after the same, as such, he has decided to sell the land. In Exh.A-3 rent register of Fasli 1369 = 1959. It only records the rent not the factum of lease or possession or cultivation by S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar. A-4 is document of the year 1949 that records the name of S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar but in that, no cultivation is recorded of S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar. It records only how much was the cess of land. No case is made out in favour of vendor of the plaintiff on the basis of the entry of amount of land cess or land revenue of the year 1949. Merely recording the cess or revenue in the year 1949 or even assuming it was paid by the vendor in 1949, is not going to confer title in favour of vendor, particularly when the area was comprised in the tank. In case any lease had been granted for the period of 1947 to 1949 ought to have been placed on record but no such lease deeds except for four years have been placed on record. Thus, the finding recorded by the High Court as to possession is clearly perverse and contrary to the revenue records and the Gazette notification of vesting of land in State issued in 1951.46. It is no doubt true that under Section 114 of the Evidence Act, there is a presumption of continuance of a state of affairs once shown to have prevailed. It is open to the court under Section 114 to presume the continuity of any fact once shown to have prevailed. Such presumption of continuity can be drawn not only forward but backward also. Court can presume that such state of affairs might have existed in past also unless discontinuity is proved. In the instant case, it is not shown by any affirmative evidence on record in the form of revenue record that the plaintiff?s vendor was in possession on the date of abolition and thereafter plaintiff remained in possession at any point of time. This Court has observed in Sir Bhimeshwara Swami Varu Temple v. Pedapudi Krishna Murthi and Ors., AIR 1973 SC 1299 that by stray entry no such presumption arises. On the other hand, the successive five attempts made by the plaintiff and his vendor failed to obtain ryotwari patta as no right in such land existed neither accrued. The plaintiff due to failure to obtain ryotwari patta and even otherwise as land formed part of tank has failed to prove entitlement to be treated as Ryot. No right, title or interest has accrued to the plaintiff to obtain any ryotwari patta or for obtaining decree in the suit.47. It was urged before us on behalf of the appellant that suit was barred by limitation by virtue of provisions contained in Article 58 of the Limitation Act 1963. The suit was required to be filed within three years. We need not go into the question. We have found on merits that absolutely no case is made out in favour of the plaintiff. Thus, he was not at all entitled for any relief.48. The High Court has considered another aspect of the difference in area, it has opined that earlier it appeared that land was 15.00 acres only later on how the area was increased to 24.62 acres has not been explained by the defendants. The aforesaid reasoning recorded by the High Court is totally based upon the ignorance of the material aspects and evidence, as a matter of fact earlier dispute land was comprised in survey no. 779 and which corresponding to new s.no. 163 in 24.67 acres, said area has been continuously recorded in the revenue papers and register of settlement, right from the beginning. After 1948 till 1995, no cogent document indicating the disparity in the area has been filed by the plaintiff. Even assuming that the finding recorded by the High Court is correct, it passes comprehension how that helps the case of the plaintiff. Plaintiff has to succeed only on the strength of his case and when temporary leases had been granted to his vendor within the area of tank as mentioned in the lease deeds which was reserved for the common use, no right could have accrued. The High Court has ignored and overlooked this material aspect. In case, the area has increased from 15 acres to 24.62 acres and has not been explained how the plaintiff can claim any right in the land which formed part of water body is not understandable as the case of the plaintiff is not at all or buttressed by the aforesaid discrepancy even if it exists. Moreover, the entire area of 24.63 acres has been recorded as Chinneri (tank) and poramboke i.e., for common use.49. Now, we deal with last ground raised by learned senior counsel on behalf of the plaintiff based on provisions contained in section 64 of the Act of 1948. Section 64 deals with the right of the owner, occupier not to be affected by temporary dispossession/discontinuance of possession. Section 64 is extracted hereunder:?Rights of owner or occupier not to be effected by temporary discontinuance of possession or occupation:64. Where a person-(a) is entitled to the ownership of to the possession or occupation of any land or building immediately before the notified date, but has transferred his right to the possession or occupation thereof or has been temporarily dispossessed or deprived or his right to the occupation thereof; and(b) has not on that date lost his right to recover the possession or occupation of such land or building;He shall, for the purposes of this Act, and subject to the provisions thereof be deemed to be the owner, or to be in possession or occupation, of such land or building;Provided that any lawful transferee of the right to the title to such land of building shall be entitled to all the rights this Act of his transferor. 50. Section 64 pre-supposes that a person is entitled to ownership or possession or occupancy of any land immediately before the notified date. In case of temporary dispossession or deprivation of his right to occupation hereafter and he has not lost the right to recover the possession of such a land or building shall for the purpose of the Act be deemed to be the owner or to be in possession or occupation of such land or building.51. There cannot be any dispute with respect to legal provisions in Section 64 of the Act of 1948. It is settled proposition of law that in case of wrongful dispossession or discontinuance of possession of owner, possession of person who has wrongfully taken it is deemed to be that of the true owner, but in the instant case, the provisions of Section 64 render no help to the plaintiff for the singular reason that his vendor is not proved to be the owner of the land nor has proved his occupation on the date of abolition or that it had been discontinued in illegal manner, no such right of vendor to remain in possession has been established. Plaintiff?s vendor was not having any right, title or interest after the lapse of temporary leases. Consequently, he did not possess any transferable right in the land. Hence, Pachiappan did not derive any right, title or interest from his predecessor in the land as he had none. Plaintiff was required to prove derivative title in which he has miserably failed. It was mentioned in recital in the sale deed by his vendor that he was not able to possess land nor could cultivate it. Apparently, the vendor of the plaintiff was not in occupation of land. Moreover, possession had been taken in 1951 of entire estate by the State Government as apparent from the Gazette notification, the land of the entire village stood vested in the State.52. The State Government has handed over the land to Salem Municipality and a major part of it has been given to the Anna Transport Corporation for the purpose of the bus stand. The High Court has observed why entire land was not given to Transport Corporation by Municipality and consequently inferred in favour of the plaintiff, only part of the land has been given could not have been made the basis by the High Court to derive a conclusion in favour of the plaintiff so as to buttress the title. The High Court has gravely erred in recording such an inferential finding. There was no scope to arrive at the same. The approach employed by the High Court is wholly impermissible, unsustainable, perverse and illegal.\",\n          \"Bachawat, J. 1. The appellant carry on the business of cultivation, manufacture and sale of tea. They own tea plantations in the State of Kerala. Some of them own tea plantations both within and outside the State. They are assessed to non-agricultural as well as agricultural incometax. Civil Appeals Nos. 936 to 939 of 1966 arise out of the agricultural income-tax assessments of the Anglo American Direct Tea Trading Co., Ltd. under the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1950 for the years 1958-59. 1959-60, 1960-61 and l961-62. Civil Appeals Nos. 585 to 588 of 1966 arise out of the agricultural income-tax assessments of the Travancore Tea Estates Co. Ltd. for the years 1957-58, 1958-59, 1959-60 and 1960-61. Civil Appeals Nos. 589 to 591 of 1966 arise out of the agricultural income-tax assessments of the Southern India Tea Estates Co. Ltd., for the years 1957-58, 1958-59 and 1959-60. For all the assessment years, the central income-tax authorities computed the total tea income of the appellants and 40 per cent thereof representing the non-agricultural income was assessed to non-agricultural income-tax and the balance 60 per cent was left unassessed as agricultural income. The appellants produced before the Agricultural Income-tax Assistant Commissioner, Kerala, the central income-tax assessment orders, and requested him to take 60 per cent of the tea income computed by the central income-tax authorities as the gross income derived from agriculture. The Agricultural Income-tax Assistant Commissioner disregarded the central income-tax assessments, and on independent computation of the tea income determined the agricultural income of the appellants. The agricultural income so determined by the Agricultural Income-tax Assistant Commissioner was much higher than 60 per cent of the total tea income assessed by the central income-tax authorities. On appeal, the Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income-tax and Sales Tax, South Zone, Quilon held that the Agricultural Income-tax Officer could make an independent computation of the tea income and was not bound to adopt the assessment made by the central Income-tax officer. On further appeal, the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Trivandrum held that the Agricultural Income-tax Officer was bound to accept the computation of tea income by the central income-tax authorities. On the application of the respondents, the Appellate Tribunal referred the following question of law to the High Court under Section 60 (1) of the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1950: \\\"Whether the Agricultural Income-tax Officer is to follow the computation of income from tea made by the Central Income-tax Officer or whether he can find out the income from tea plantations applying the provisions of the Income-tax Act and make the assessment exercising his powers under the Agricultural Income-tax Act?\\\". Following its earlier decision in Commr. of Agricultural Income-tax, Kerala v. Perumal Plantations Ltd., (1965) 56 ITR 193 (Ker), the High Court held that the Agricultural Income-tax Officer was not obliged to accept the computation of the tea income made by the Income-tax Officer acting under the Income-tax Act, and it was open to him to compute the income independently applying the relevant provisions of the income-tax Act and the Agricultural Income-tax Act. From these orders the present appeals have been filed by special leave. 2. Before answering the aforesaid question it is necessary to refer to the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions. Under Entry 46, List II, Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, the State Legislature is competent make laws with regard to \\\"taxes on agricultural income\\\" Under Entry 82, List I, Parliament is competent to make laws with respect to taxes on income other than agricultural income In view of Article 366 (1) agricultural income means \\\"agricultural income as defined for the purposes of the enactments relating to Indian Income-tax.\\\" Article 274 (I) provides that a bill which seeks to vary this meaning requires the prior recommendation of the President. These provisions of the Constitution correspond to Sections 141(1), 311 (2), Sch. VII, List I, Entry 54, List II, Entry 41 of the Government of India Act, 1935. Section 2 (1) of the Indian income-tax Act, 1922 defined agricultural income. Section 10 provided for computation of income derived from business. Section 59 empowered the Central Board of Revenue to make rules which took effect as if enacted in the Act. Rules 23 and 24 of the Indian Income-tax Rules, 1922 framed under Section 59 provided for computation of the business profits where the income WAS derived partly from agriculture and partly from business. Under Rule 23, the market value of the agricultural produce used as raw material in the business was deducted in computing the business profits. Rule 24 provided that \\\"income derived from the sale of tea grown and manufactured by the seller in the taxable territories shall be computed as if it were income derived from business, and 40 per cent of such income shall be deemed to be income, profits and gains liable to tax, provided that in computing such income an allowance shall be made in respect of the cost of planting bushes in replacement of bushes that have died or become permanently useless in an area already planted, unless such area has previously been abandoned.\\\" These pro-visions correspond to Sections 2 (1), 28 to 44 and 295 of the Income-lax Act, 1961 and rules 7 anti 8 of the Income-tax Rules, 1962. Section 2 (a) of the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1950 defines agricultural income. The Explanation to Section 2 (a) (2) provides that \\\"agricultural income derived from such land by the cultivation of tea means that portion of the income derived from the cultivation, manufacture and sale of tea as is defined to be agricultural income for the purposes of the enactments relating to Indian Income-tax,\\\" Section 3 is the charging section.Section 2 (s) read with Sections 4, 5, 9 and 10 define total agricultural income. Section 5 provides for computation of agricultural income after making certain deductions. The proviso to S. 5 lays down that \\\"no deduction shall be made under this Section if it has already beer; made in the assessment under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.\\\" Section 6 provides for assessment of income derived from lands partly within the State and partly without. Section 7 relates to the method of accounting Section 17 deals with return of income. Section 18 provides for assessment of income. Sections 21 to 29 provide for assessments in special cases. Section 35 provides for assessment of income escaping assessment. Section 36 provides for rectification of mistakes. Section 67 empowers the Government to make rules. Rule 9 of the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Rules, 1951 prescribes the deductions allowable under Section 5 (1) for depreciation of buildings, machinery plant and furniture in respect of tea factories Rule 15 prescribes the method of apportionment of income derived from lands partly within the State and partly without. 3. In Karimtharuvi Tea Estates Ltd., Kottayam v. State of Kerala, 1963 Supp 1 SCR 823= (AIR 1963 SC 760 ), this Court held that Explanation 2 to Section 5 of the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act added in 1961 disallowing certain deductions in the computation of agricultural income did not apply to computation of agricultural income derived from tea plantations. The reasons for this conclusion may be summarised thus: The definition of agricultural income in the Constitution and the Indian Income-tax Act 1922 is hound up with Rule 24 of the Income-tax Rules 1922. Income derived from the sale of tea grown and manufactured by the seller is to be computed under R. 24 as if it were income derived from business in accordance with the provisions of S. 10 of the Indian Income-tax Act. The Explanation to S. 2 (a) (2) of the Kerala Act adopts this rule of computation. Of the income so computed, 40 percent is to be treated as income liable to income-tax and the ether 60 per cent only is deemed to be agricultural income within the meaning of that expression in the Income-tax Act. The power of the State legislature to make a law in respect of taxes on agricultural income arising from tea plantation is limited to legislating with respect to the agricultural income so determined. The legislature cannot add to the amount of the agricultural income so determined by disallowing any item of deductions allowable under R. 24 read with S. 10 (2) (xv) of the Indian Income-tax Act. Explanation 2 to S. 5 of the Kerala Act if applied to income from tea plantations would create an agricultural income which is not contemplated by the Income-tax Act and the Constitution and would be void, and it should therefore be construed not to apply to the computation of income from tea plantations. 4. The question arising in these appeals is whether the Agricultural Income tax Officer making an assessment of agricultural in come under the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act is bound to accept the assessment of the income which has already been made by the Central Income-tax authorities under R. 24 of the Income-tax Rules, 1922 read with S. 10 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 or under R. 8 of the Income-tax Rules 1962 read with Ss. 28 to 44 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.We think that this question should be answered in the affirmative. Income from sale of tea grown and manufactured by the seller is derived partly from business and partly from agriculture. This income has to be computed as if it were income from business under the Central Income-tax Act and Rules, 40 per cent of the income so computed is deemed to be income derived from business and assessable to non-agricultural income-tax. Having regard to the decision in 1963 Supp 1 SCR 823 = (AIR 1963 SC 760 ), we are bound to hold that (a) the Explanation to S. 2 (a) (2) of the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act adopts this rule of computation and (b) the balance 60 per cent of the income so computed is agricultural income within the meaning of the Central Income-tax Act and the Constitution. The agricultural income taxable under the Kerala Act is 60 per cent of the income so computed after deducting therefrom the allowances authorised by S. 5 of the Kerala Act in so far as the same has not already been allowed in the assessment under the Central Income-tax Act. There is no provision in the Kerala Act authorising the Agricultural Income-tax Officer to disregard the computation of the tea income made by the income-tax authorities acting under the Central Income-tax Acts. The Agricultural Income-tax Officer in making an assessment of agricultural income is bound to accept the computation of the tea income already made by the Central Income-tax authorities and to assess only 60 per cent of the income so computed less allowable deductions as agricultural income taxable under the Kerala Act. Where the agricultural income is derived from lands partly within the State of Kerala and partly outside the State, the portion of the income attributable to lands within the State is determined under S. 6 of the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act read with R. 15 of the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Rules. 5. Our attention was drawn to the provisions of (a) Ss. 8 (2), 24 (1) proviso 24 (2) proviso; 25 (4) and 25, (5) of the Bengal Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1944 and Rules 7 and 8 of the Bengal Agricultural Income-tax Rules 1944, (b) S. 8 of the Mysore Agricultural Income-tax. Act, 1957 and Rule 6 of the Mysore Agricultural Income-tax Rules, 1957, (c) S. 8 of the Coorg Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1951, (d) the second proviso to S. 8 of the Assam Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1939 and Rule 5 of the Assam Agricultural Income-tax Rules, 1939 (e) Explanation 1 to S. 2 (a) (2) of the Madras Plantations Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1955 and R 7 (1) of the Madras Plantations Agricultural Income-tax Rules, 1955 and (f) R 5 of the Bihar Agricultural Income-tax Rules. 1949. Under some Acts and Rules, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer is bound to adopt the assessment of the tea income made by the Central Income-tax authorities. But under some other Acts and Rules he is authorised in special cases to disregard this assessment and to make a fresh computation of the tea income.We express no opinion on the construction of these Acts and Rules. For the purpose of these appeals, it is sufficient to say that the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act and Rules do not confer upon the Agricultural Income-tax Officer the power to disregard the assessment of the tea income already made by the Central income-tax authorities. We are unable to introduce by way of implication in a taxing statute a provision which requires explicit statement. 6. Difficulties may arise in making an assessment of agricultural income under the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act on the basis of the Assessment of the tea income made by the Central income-tax authorities. The previous year under S. 2 (o) (i) of the Kerala Act may be different from the previous year under the Indian Income-tax Act. This difficulty may be resolved by fixing the previous year for this class of income under S. 2 (o) (ii) in conformity with the previous year under the Indian Income-tax Act. But the artificial previous year under S. 2-A is not subject to the provisions of S. 2 (o) (ii). Moreover, S. 22 authorises the assessment of income for the period from the expiry of a previous year to the probable date of the departure of the assessee from the State. It may be difficult to make an assessment under S. 22 or on the basis of the previous year under S. 2-A in the absence of any rule fixing the income for a broken part of the year with reference to an assessment made under the Indian Income-tax Act. In spite of these and other difficulties in the working of the Act, we are unable to agree with the decision in (1965) 56 ITR 193 (Ker) or to hold that the Agricultural income-tax Officer can ignore the assessment of the tea income already made by the Central income-tax authorities. 7. On behalf of the appellants, it was argued that the power to compute business income under R. 24 read with S. 10 of the Indian Income-tax Act having regard particularly to proviso (a) to sub-s. (2) (vi), the proviso to sub-s. 2 (vi-b), sub-clause (g) of the second proviso to sub-s. 2 (xiv), sub-s. (4-A) and the first proviso to sub-s. 5 (a) of S. 10 must be exercised by the Central Income-tax Officer alone, that there is no provision in the Kerala Act conferring this power on the Agricultural Income-tax Officer and that therefore the assessment of agricultural income must wait until the assessments by the Central Income-tax Officer under R. 24 read with S 10. This wider question does not arise for decision and is left open. In all the cases before us, the assessments by the Central income-tax Officer were completed before the Agricultural Income-tax Officer proceeded to assess the agricultural income.For the purpose of these appeals, it is sufficient to say that the Agricultural Income-tax Officer acting under the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act 1950 is bound to follow the assessment of income by the Central Income-tax Officer under R. 24 of the income-tax Rules, 1922 and R 8 of the Income-tax Rules 1962 where such assessment has been made before the Agricultural Income-tax Officer proceeds to make the assessment under the Kerala Act.The question referred to the High Court is answered accordingly. We must not be understood to say that the assessment made by the Central Income- tax Officer under R 23 of the Income tax Rules, 1962 or R 7 of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 is in any way binding on the Agricultural Income-tax Officer. 8. In Civil Appeals Nos. 585 to 588 of 1966 and 589 to 591 of 1966, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer made a surcharge of 5 per cent for the assessment year 1957-58 under the Kerala Surcharge on Taxes Act, 1957. On appeal, the Deputy Commissioner held that the surcharge was rightly made. On further appeal, the Appellate Tribunal held that the levy of the surcharge was illegal. On the application of the respondent, the Appellate Tribunal referred the following additional question of law to the High Court. \\\"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal is justified in holding that surcharge on agricultural Income-tax cannot be levied for the assessment year 1957-58?\\\" The High Court answered this question in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee. This decision must be set aside.In Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Ltd. v. State of Kerala, (1966) 60 ITR 262 = (AIR 1966 SC 1385 ) this Court held that no surcharge on agricultural income can be levied under the Kerala Surcharge on Taxes Act, 1957 in respect of the assessment year 1957-58. The second question is answered accordingly in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue.\",\n          \"Shah, J.1. One S. K. Mohideen-hereinafter referred to as the assessee-was a partner in two firms-Messrs. Dinshaw and Co. and Messrs. Palanippa Chettiar and Co. The firms were registered under the Indian Income Tax Act. The assessee submitted returns of his income and incorporated therein the estimated share of his losses in the two firms at Rs. 20, 000/- and Rs. 10, 000/- for the assessment year 1946-47 and at Rs. nil and Rs. 12, 436/- for the assessment year 1947-48. The Income-tax Officer, V. Circle, Madras completed the assessment for the two years on February 20, 1950 after adopting the estimates furnished by the assessee, but he made a note that the losses accepted were subject to revision on ascertainment of correct particulars. The assessment of Messrs. Dinshaw & Co, for the years 1946-47 and 1947-48 was completed on October 31, 1950 by the Income-tax officer II Circle, Madrass and the proportionate share of the assessee for the losses was computed for the two years at Rs. 15, 839/- and Rs. 1, 046/- respectively. Assessment of Messrs. Palaniappa Chettiar & Co. for 1947-48 was completed by the Income-tax Officer, Special Circle on June 30, 1951 and the share of the assessee in the loss suffered by that firm was computed at Rs. 2, 009/-. On receipt of intimation of the orders passed in the assessment of the two firms, the Income-tax officer, V Circle, Madras issued on May 4, 1953 notices to show cause why the assessments of the asessee, for the years 1946-47 and 1947-48 should not be rectified under s. 35 of the Income-tax Act. On March 24, 1954, the assessee wrote to the Income-tax Officer stating: \\\"This is to inform you that I have no objection in completing the assessments of the previous years in accordance with law\\\". On March 27, 1954, the Income-tax officer revised the assessment of the assessee in respect of the two years after taking into account the share of the losses as computed in the assessments of the two firms.The assessee died on April 17, 1954 and his son S. K. Habibullah-hereinafter referred to as the respondent-applied to the Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras praying for revision of the orders. The Commissioner held that s. 35 was properly invoked for rectification of the assessments and rejected the applications. But the High Court of Judicature at Madras in petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution filed by the respondent ordered that writs of certiorari do issue quashing the orders of the Income-tax Officer, V Circle. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras appeals to this Court with certificate of fitness granted by the High Court.2. The plea of the Commissioner that the assessee having assented to the rectification, it was not open to the respondent to challenge the authority of the Income-tax officer, has no force. By his letter dated March 24, 1954 the assessee merely informed the Income-tax officer that he had no objection to rectification according to law. But if the law did not authorise the Income-tax Officer to rectify the assessment, assent could not validate what was unauthorised.3. Section 35(1) empowers the income-tax authorities to rectify mistakes apparent from the record of certain orders passed by them. The clause (omiting parts not material) provides that the Income-tax officer may at any time within four years from the date of any assessment order passed by him, on his own motion rectify any mistake apparent from the record of the assessment. The power of rectification may be exercised subject to two conditions: (1) that there is a mistake apparent from the record of the assessment, and (2) that the order of rectification is made within four years from the date of the assessment sought to be rectified. The mistake which may be rectified need not be in the order itself: it may be in any part of the record or proceeding of assessment of the assessee. But for the purpose of assessment an individual and a firm are distinct entities and even if an individual is a partner of the firm, a mistake discovered because of something contained in the assessment of the firm is not a mistake apparent from the record of assessment of the individual partner. In Kanumar lapaudi Lakshminarayana Chetty v. First Additionnal Income-tax Officer, Nellore(1) in dealing with the question whether the record of the assessment of the firm may be regarded as the record of the assessment of the individual partner, Subba Rao, C.J. speaking for the Court observed, and, in our Judgment, correctly: \\\"But it is said that section 35 of the Act even without the amendment would have enabled the Income Tax authorities to reopen the assessment on the ground that there was a Mistake apparent from the record. But from the record of final assessment, it is impossible to say that there was a mistake apparent from the record, for the assessing authority accepted a certain figure as representing the share of the assessees in the firm and made a final assessment. The mistake is not in the record but by a subsequent assessment of the firm it was discovered that the earlier assessment, was wrong to the extent of the assessees share in the firm. It is not a mistake apparent from the record but a mistake discovered from the disposal of another case\\\".Section 35(1) of the Income-Tax Act could not therefore be resorted to by the Income-tax authorities for rectification of the assessments of the assessee, for there was no error apparent from the record of those assessments.4. The Income tax Officer, however, sought to rely upon s. 35(5) which was incorporated by s. 19 of the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1953 (25 of 1953) with effect from April 1, 1952. The clause which was incorporated is in the following terms \\\"(5) Where in respect of any completed assessment of a partner in a firm it is found on the assessment or reassessment of the firm or any reduction or enhancement made in the income of the firm under section 31, Section 66, Section 66A, Section 33B, Section 66 or Section 66A that the share of the partner in the profit or loss of the firm has not been included, in the assessment of the partner or, if included, is not correct, the inclusion of the share in the assessment or the correction thereof, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be a rectification of a mistake apparent from the record within the meaning of this Section, and the provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply thereto accordingly, the period of four years referred to in that sub-section being computed from the date of the final order passed in the case of the firm.\\\"5. Clause (5) was one of a group of clauses, added by Act 25 of 1953, dealing with rectification of assessments. Clause (5) dealt with inclusion of income or correction of the income of a partner in a firm consequent upon assessment or reassessment of the firm of which he was a partner. Clause (6) dealt with recomputation of total income of an assessee in consequence of modifications made in the Excess Profits Tax or the Business Profits Tax payable by an assessee subsequent to an assessment made under the Indian Income-tax Act. Clause (7) dealt with rectification consequent upon modification of orders under 8. 23A of the Income- tax Act cl.(8), which was enacted (in the form in which it now exists) by the Indian Finance Act, 1956, dealt with the rectification consequent upon proceedings in reassessment under 8. 34 (1) (a) or 8. 31 (1A). The Legislature by a fiction in all these classes of cases regarded the inclusion, correction, computation or recomputation as rectification of a mistake apparent from the record and prescribed special termini reckoning for the period of four years within which the rectification must be made, Under. cl. (5) with which alone we are directly concerned in these appeals, the inclusion of the share in the assessment of the partners or the correction thereof is deemed to be a mistake apparent from the record within the meaning of the section, and sub-s. (1) applied thereto accordingly-the period of four years being computed from the date of the final order passed in the case of the firm. The discrepancy disclosed as a result of assessment, or reassessment of a firm between the share of a partner included in the individual assessment of that partner and his share disclosed in the assessment of the firm was not an error apparent from the record within the meaning of s. 35(1) and the Legislature enacted a fiction making the inclusion of the share in the assessment or correction thereof such a mistake. If the inclusion of the share or the correction of the assessment were an error apparent from the record and falling under cl. (1) of 8. 35, the enactment of 1. (5) was plainly unnecessary. When the Legislature has deliberately enacted a fiction of the nature set out in cl. (5), we are unable to agree with the contention raised by counsel for the Revenue that the enactment of the fiction was ex-abundanti cautela. Rectification of the nature contemplated by cl. (5) could not have been effected under cl. (1), and to remove the lacuna the legislature declared that what was not a mistake should for the purpose of rectification of assessment be regarded as a mistake apparent from the record and provided a terminus for the computation of the period of four years.The assessments of the two firms were completed a long time before April 1, 1952 It is also common ground that the individual assessments of the assessee were not provisional but final assessments under 8. 23 (3) of the Income-tax Act.6. The question which falls to be considered is whether relying upon cl. (5) of s. 35 an Income tax Officer may rectify the assessment of a person who is a partner of a firm when the assessment of the firm is completed before the 1st of April, 1952. The Legislature has given to cl. (5) a partial retrospective operation. The provision enacted by cl. (5) is not procedural in character: it affects vested rights of the assessee. Therefore in the absence of compelling reasons the court would not be justified in giving a greater retrospectivity to the provision than is warranted by the plain words used by the Legislature. As observed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Income-tax Commissioner v. Khemchand Ramdas : \\\" x x x x when once a final assessment is arrived at, it cannot, in s their Lordships opinion, be reopened except in the circumstances detailed in sections 34 and 35 of the Act x x x and within the time limited by those section.\\\"7. The orders of assessment are, subject to the provisions relating to appeals, revisions, reassessment and rectification, final: it is not open to the Income-tax Officer to reopen the assessment because he thinks fit to do so. The provisions relating to assessments and rectification or reopening thereof are exhaustive, and may not be extended by analogies. The right to rectify an assessment may therefore be exercised in strict compliance with conditions prescribed by the statute in that behalf. Before April 1, 1952, rectification of assessment of an individual on the disclosure of errors consequent upon assessment of the firm of which he is a partner was not for reasons already stated permissible under cl. (1) of s. 35 This power was conferred for the first time by cl. (5) as from April 1, 1952, and by the express words of the clause arose from the assessment of the firm. If by the law prevailing at the time when the assessment of the firm was made, no such result as is contemplated by the new clause (5) arose, to give a larger retrospective operation than is directed, is to ascribe to the Legislature an intention different from the one expressed, and to make a larger inroad upon the finality of that assessment than is permitted by the Legislature. Section 35(5) does not purport to amend cl. (1); that clause is left untouched by the amending statute. Its application, by fiction, is extended to other clauses of cases by declaring what in truth are not mistakes, as mistakes. clause (5), therefore confers an additional power of rectification upon the Income- tax authorities and in the absence of compelling reasons we will not be justified in upholding the exercise of the power to assessments of firms which have been completed before the date on which the power was invested.Some assistance may be derived from the phraseology used by the legislature in cl. (6) which was enacted simultaneously with. cl. (5). That clause provides, omitting parts which are not material: \\\"Where the excess profits tax or the business profits tax payable by an assessee has been modified x x x x or where any excess profits tax or business profit tax has been assessed after the completion of the corresponding assessment for income-tax (whether before or after the commencement of the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1953), and in consequence thereof it is necessary to recompute the total income of the assessee chargeable to income-tax, such recomputation shall be deemed to be a rectification of a mistake apparent from the record within the meaning of this section, x x x\\\".8. Manifestly, by the express provisions contained in cl. (6) the fiction applies whether the assessment is completed before or after the commencement of the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1953. Even though cl. (6) is also made retrospectively operative as from April 1, 1952, the legislature has authorised the revenue authorities after April 1, 1952 to pass an order recomputing the total income of the assessee whether or not the assessment was completed before the commencement of the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1953. It is true that by the Explanation to that clause, for the purposes of this sub-section, where the assessee is a firm, the provisions of sub-s. (5) shall also apply as they apply to the rectification of the assessment of the partners of the firm, but thereby an intention to give a larger retrospective operation to cl. (5), in so far as it deals with rectification of assessments of partners consequential upon the completion of the assessment of the firm in which they are partners, is not indicated. When the legislature under cl. (6) of s. 35 expressly authorised rectification in the circumstances mentioned therein even if the assessment has been completed before the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1953, and it made no such provision in cl. (5), it would be reasonable to infer that the Legislature did not intend to grant to the revenue authorities a power to rectify assessments falling within cl. (5) where the firms assessment was completed before April 1, 1952.In our view, it was rightly held in Kandan Lal v. Income-tax Officer following Kanumaralapudi Lakshminarayana Chetty v. First Additional Income- Tax Officer, Nellore that cl. (5), of s. 35 of the Indian Income-tax Act, which was enacted by the Income Tax, (Amendment) Act, 1953, was not declaratory of pre-existing law, and as it clearly affected vested right which had accrued to the assessee, must be deemed to have come into force from April 1, 1952. It had no greater retrospective effect than was expressly granted to it. The power to rectify assessment of a partner consequent upon the assessment of the firm of which he is a partner by including or correcting his share of profit or loss can therefore be exercised only in Case of assessment of the firm made on or after April 1, 1952. The Income-tax officer has no jurisdiction under cl. (5 ) of s. 35 of the Act to rectify the assessment of a partner of a firm consequent upon the assessment or reassessment of the firm disclosing an error made before April 1, 1952.9.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12044,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0[ds]It is noteworthy that the question which was, referred is couched in general terms and was not limited to or circumscribed by the reasons which had been given by the Tribunal against the assessee. The question of law on which reference can be made must arise out of the order of the Tribunal. The order which was made in the present case was in favour of the department and against the assessee. It is true that certain reasons which had appealed to the Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner were not accepted by the Appellate Tribunal but it had come to the following conclusion which was material for the disposal of theIn our opinion even if the conclusion of the High Court on the point mentioned above is not taken into consideration the question which was referred had to be answered against the assessee. On admitted and proved facts there can be no manner of doubt that the assessee did not acquire the preference shares in the ordinary course of business.All the above facts ad circumstances which have some extraordinary features lead to the irresistible conclusion that whatever the motives which entered into the acquisition of the shares, they were certainly not bought and sold in ordinary course of business of the assessee as a dealer in shares. The answer to the question must, therefore, be in the negative and against the assessee and it was rightly so returned by the Highfacts may be restated asThe market rate of the preference shares remained constant at the figure of Rs. 119 between April 16, 1952 and May 21, 1952.(2) On May 21, 1952 the agreement between Mugneeram Bangur and Kettlewell Bullen and Co. was entered into for purchasing the entire holding of the managing agency company in the managed company.(3) On May 22, 1952, 1620 shares were acquired by the assessee from Mugneeram Bangur and Co., at the rate of Rs. 186 per share. 50 more shares were acquired on May 27, 1952 at Rs. 184 per shar. The shares were obviously acquired at a price which was very much higher than the market price which prevailed only a day before they were purchased by the assessee.(4) Out of 1670 shares taken over by the assessee from Mugneeram Bangur and Co. 1575 were sold back to the same company at the rate of Rs. 115 per share.(5) The profit and loss account for the assessment year 1954-55 showed that the dealings in other shares were of comparatively much lesser value than the shares in question. The profits and losses which had been made and incurred on account of the other shares were also comparatively of minimal nature.(6) The shares of Fort William Jute Co. Ltd., were purchased by the assessee by obtaining an overdraft from aTribunal had negatived the finding of theOfficer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the preference shares had been acquired by the assessee as a pawn in the scheme of transfer of the managing agency of Fort William Jute Co. Ltd. It was, therefore, not open to the High Court to come to the same conclusion by not treating the finding of the Appellate Tribunal as final. Our attention has been invited to the observations in Commissioner ofBombay City I v. Greaves and Co., Ltd., (1968) 68 ITR 200 (SC), that it is not open to the High Court in a reference under Section 66 (1) of theAct 1922 to embark upon aof the evidence and to arrive at findings of fact contrary to those of the Tribunal. The finding of fact will be defective in law if there is no evidence to support it or if the finding is unreasonable or perverse, but it is not open to a party to challenge such a finding unless reference has been made of a specific question concerning that finding. In Oriental Investment Co., P. Ltd. Commissioner of72 ITR 408  =(AIR 1969 SC 460  ) it has been reiterated that in dealing with findings on questions of mixed law and fact, the High Court must accept the findings of the Tribunal on the primary question of fact as final although it is open to the High Court to examine whether the tribunal had applied the relevant legal principles correctly. It is argued that the High Court has not characterised the aforesaid finding of the Appellate Tribunal as perverse or arbitrary and once that finding is accepted, there would be no justification for holding that the assessee had been made a pawn in the matter of the scheme of transfer of the managing agency of Fort William Jute Co., Ltd., by Mugneeram Bangur and Co., or Bangur Brothers Ltd. In any case there were several facts which showed that the assessee was not privy or party to the aforesaid scheme. It did not acquire any interest in the managing agency nor was it a subsidiary or associate of Mugneeram Bangur group of concerns. The assessee was connected with the Bangurs only to the extent that out of its four Directors two of the Directors were Bangurs.\",\n          \"1[ds]9. Although the definition ofis an inclusive one, it is clear that materials, commodities and articles spoken of in the definition take colour from one another. In order to beit is clear that they should be known to the market as materials, commodities and articles that are capable of being sold.The facts in the present case show that Transmission Assemblies of tractors are commercially known products as has been pointed out above. The fact that not a single sale of such Assembly has been made by the appellants is irrelevant. This being the case, we are of the view that the Transmission Assembly of the tractor on the facts before us is clearly an intermediate product which is a distinct product commercially known to the market as such. On this ground therefore, the appellants are not liable to succeed.Added to this, the appellants have also clearly stated that not a single Transmission Assembly has in fact been sold by them in the market. On these facts, we are of the opinion that the appellants would fall within the test laid down in two judgments of this Court.Judged by this test, it is clear that on facts in the present case there was no suppression on the part of the appellants nor was there any willful attempt to evade duty. As stated by the appellant, the appellant has been manufacturing tractors from 1965 onwards. There has never been any change in the manufacturing process. In the year 1994-95, IC engines were stated by the department to contain Transmission Assemblies, which were dutiable. On receiving a reply from the appellant, the department did not levy any excise duty on such Transmission Assemblies. The show-cause notice itself stated that the issue of manufacture and captive consumption of Transmission Assemblies for tractors is the same as that for IC engines. These facts, coupled with the fact that not a single Transmission Assembly of tractors manufactured by the appellant had been sold makes it clear that there was no suppression or any intent to evade excise duty in the present case. We feel that the show cause notice needs to be quashed on this ground alone. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, and the judgment dated 27.5.2004 passed by CESTAT is set aside.In view of what is stated in Civil Appeal No.6561 of 2004, the part of the order in original and the CESTAT order on merits have to be set aside. However, for the self-same reasons as are contained in Civil Appeal No.6561 of 2004, we hold that the extended period of limitation is not available as we are satisfied that the reply extracted above of the respondent shows that the respondent bona fide believed that Transmission Assemblies were not dutiable. In the circumstances, the appeals of the revenue shall stand dismissed on this ground.The facts in this appeal are as follows. The period involved is April, 1996 to May, 1998 and the show cause notice is dated 1.5.2001. As the impugned judgment in this case by CESTAT merely follows the Escorts case i.e. Civil Appeal No.6561 of 2004, we hold that the finding of the authorities on merits is correct. However, in this case also the extended period of limitation is not available to theintention to evade duty is clear from the statement of Shri P.C. Kale dated 12.04.2001 as the noticee was knowing that duty is required to be paid on the goods which go into the assembly of the tractor of engine capacity less than 1800 CC. As such tractors were exempt from duty during the relevant period. Knowing this fact very well and not declaring the transmission assembly or chassis assembly in the classification declaration and clearing such transmission assembly/ chassis assembly without payment of duty without recording their production in the statutory records and without filing the RT-12 returns for the production and clearance of such transmission assembly/ chassis assembly clearly established that this was done with an intention to evade payment of duty.We find that in successive declarations made by the assessee in this case starting from 16.3.1995 the assessee had declared not merely the tractor but the chassis therefor. The assessee bonafide believed that the declaration of the chassis would suffice as according to them Transmission Assemblies were not taxable goods. The intention to evade duty is according to the Commissioner made out from a statement made by Shri P.C. Kale dated 12.4.2001. It is pointed out by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that in the memorandum of appeal filed against the order in original, Shri P.C. Kale was never in the employment of the appellant during the relevant period as he joined the appellant only in July, 2000. Apart from this, it is also pointed out that the appellant is a public sector company governed by a Board of Directors consisting of IAS Officers.\",\n          \"1[ds]f contends that in changing the categories of these workmen, the tribunal through error has failed to notice the fact that it was common ground between the parties before the tribunal that the classification and the categories prescribed by the earlier award had not to be changed and the only question which the tribunal was asked to decide in the present proceedings was one in regard to the revision of wages payable to the employees in the respective categories andseems to us that the grievance made by the appellant isThere is no doubt that before the tribunal, parties had agreed to take the skill of the various categories as it was prescribed by the earlier award and it has in fact observed that in view of the admission of the parties regarding classification. \\\"the categories and classification of the respective employees had to be take as it was specified in annexure A, \\\" annexure A containing the categories and the classification of the respective employees made in the earlier award. It is to be regretted that the tribunal proceeded to change the classification in respect of four categories of employees to which we have just referred, overlooking the fact that by virtue of the agreement between the parties, it was not competent to the tribunal to adopt such a course.Sri Sowani for the respondents attempted to argue that the tribunal has created a category of assistants, and so, it thought that it would be anomalous to treat an assistant mason, an assistant welder, an assistant carpenter or an assistant moulder asand the mason, the welder, the carpenter and the moulder also asThat may perhaps explain why the tribunal changed the classification in respect of the four categories of employees. In the present appeal, no grievance is made by the appellant in regard to the creation of certain assistant in the category ofemployees, and so, we are not called upon to consider whether the tribunal could have created this class of assistants, but it seems to us that the tribunal was not justified in promoting the four categories of employees into the skilled class in a manner which was inconsistent with the classification adopted by the earlier award. That is why we must hold that in regard to the mason, the welder the carpenter and the moulder, the classification must be deemed to be the same as was adopted by the earlier award. In regard to the assistant moulder, the appellants grievance is that there is no person who answers the description of that office. We propose to express no opinion on this part of the appellants case. If there are employees who can be regarded as assistant moulders under the award, their rights will not be affected, because the appellant has not seriously contended that the tribunal was not competent to create a class of assistant moulders, just as it has not been argued that a class of assistant masons, assistant fitter and other assistants could not have been created.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11929,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5601,\n        \"min\": 176,\n        \"max\": 117747,\n        \"samples\": [\n          45599,\n          5928\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6678,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Decision_Count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1339,\n        \"min\": 7,\n        \"max\": 37833,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4892,\n          944\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2984,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def preprocess_case(text):\n","  max_tokens = 1000\n","  tokens = text.split(' ')\n","  num_tokens_to_extract = min(max_tokens, len(tokens))\n","  text1 = ' '.join(tokens[-num_tokens_to_extract:len(tokens)])\n","  return text1"],"metadata":{"id":"yDJD_msjGNeY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for i,row in df.iterrows():\n","  input = row['Input']\n","  input = preprocess_case(input)\n","  df.at[i,'Input'] = input"],"metadata":{"id":"hFT--O0mN-X1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#prediction and explanation\n","def format_instruction(sample, inst):\n","\treturn f\"\"\"### Instruction:\n","{inst}\n","\n","### Input:\n","{sample['Input']}\n","\n","### Response:\n","{sample['Output'].split('[ds]')[0]}\n","\n","### Explanation:\n","{preprocess_case(sample['Output'].split('[ds]')[1])}\n","\"\"\"\n","#prediction\n","\n","# def format_instruction(sample, inst):\n","# \treturn f\"\"\"### Instruction:\n","# {inst}\n","\n","# ### Input:\n","# {sample['Input']}\n","\n","# ### Response:\n","# {sample['Output'].split('[ds]')[0]}\n","# \"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"qmIpKv-tHhnc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_ins = pd.read_csv(\"instruction_decision.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"VU8gHqbhI_KC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","random.seed(15)\n","text = []\n","for i,row in tqdm(df.iterrows()):\n","  random_index = random.randint(0, len(df_ins) - 1)\n","  t = format_instruction(df.iloc[i],df_ins['Instructions_Exp'][random_index])\n","  #t = format_instruction(df.iloc[i],df_ins['Instructions'][random_index])\n","  text.append(t)"],"metadata":{"id":"wBOa23zJxI2i","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"ca63a022-301c-483f-8d22-2132c342c587","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708193561824,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4225,"user":{"displayName":"NLP Research Lab","userId":"16405893252517130352"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["12178it [00:03, 3213.05it/s]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.loc[:, \"text\"] = text"],"metadata":{"id":"qxswSQeHyXxk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Set a random state for reproducibility\n","random_state = 42\n","\n","# Calculate the number of rows for validation set (10%)\n","val_size = int(0.1 * len(df))\n","\n","df_val = df.sample(n=val_size, random_state=random_state)\n","\n","df_train = df.drop(df_val.index)\n","\n","df_train.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n","df_val.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"Z8EsdzGZxkEK"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train.to_csv(\"train_ft.csv\",index=False)\n","df_val.to_csv(\"val_ft.csv\",index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"aw_WtQ8NynIJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
